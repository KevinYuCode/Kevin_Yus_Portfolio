            My name is Kevin Yu, and I'm a 2024 Computer Engineering graduate
            from Queen's University. I am currently seeking full-time
            opportunities in Software Development and Frontend Engineering.

            While between jobs, Iâ€™m spending time with my family, helping out at
            their restaurant, and focusing on learning new skills and working on
            side projects to grow as an engineer. At the moment, Iâ€™m developing
            a self-service kiosk for my familyâ€™s restaurantâ€”stay tuned for the
            final result!
