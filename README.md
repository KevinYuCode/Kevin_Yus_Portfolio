# Kevin Yu's Personal Website Portfolio: www.kevinyu.ca

Howdy! My name is Kevin Yu. I'm a 4th year Computer Engineering student at Queens University. I developed this website as a way to document my journey as an Engineer and showcase my work to the world. 

Feel free to reach out to me or ask any questions about my work, life, or school. 

I'm happy to connect!
